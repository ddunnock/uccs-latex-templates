HOW TO COMPLY WHEN DISTRIBUTING THIS REPOSITORY
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* When cloning, forking, or redistributing:
  * Keep this entire `LICENSE` file intact.
  * Preserve the `OFL.txt` that accompanies Fira Sans in
    `texmf/fonts/otf/` (or include an unmodified copy of the OFL-1.1 text
    if you reorganize directories).
  * Do **not** remove, alter, or obscure the UCCS logo trademark notice.
* If you publish PDFs generated from these sources, the embedded
  `Fira Sans` font subsets automatically satisfy the OFL's embedding
  requirement. The PDF itself may be shared under any terms you choose,
  provided the UCCS logo appears only in contexts permitted by CU policy.
